        <h2>Description</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>4 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Beat egg yolks and sugar until frothy in a large bowl.
                Gradually pour warm milk into egg yolks and sugar, whisking constantly. 
                Return mixture to saucepan; cook over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon until the mixture gels slightly and coats the back of the spoon. 
                If small egg lumps begin to show, remove from heat immediately.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture through a sieve or fine strainer into a bowl. Cover, and chill for 2 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker, and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions.
